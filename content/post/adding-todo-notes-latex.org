Many researchers and programmers have a tendency to add =todo= and =fixme= to their comments to mark stuff to be fixed. Such placeholders are available in \(\LaTeX\)   too. 
The easiest way is to use the [[https://www.ctan.org/pkg/todonotes][=todonotes=]] package.

#+BEGIN_SRC latex :exports code
\documentclass[draft,10pt]{article}
\usepackage[paperwidth=3in,paperheight=2in,margin=1cm,noheadfoot]{geometry}
\usepackage{todonotes}
\setuptodonotes{inline}
\begin{document}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
\todo{This is a todo note}
Introduction to the article.

\end{document}
#+END_SRC

The todo-notes appear as below

The =todonotes= are shown in the generated document. They are shown only when the document is in draft. When the document option is made to final from draft, the todonotes are hidden.

For finer control, and collaboration with other authors, you should use the [[https://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixme][=fixme=]] package.
